LM Classifiers
==============

The following classes are the core elements of this library. :code:`MaskedLM4Classification` is based on
`masked <https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=fill-mask>`_ language models, while
:code:`CausalLM4Classification`  is based on `causal <https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation>`_
language models. The idea behind this concept is described in :ref:`background`.

The tutorials :ref:`tutorial_causal_lms` and :ref:`tutorial_masked_lms` describe how these classes are applied.
