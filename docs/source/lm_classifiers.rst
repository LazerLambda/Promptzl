LM Classifiers
==============

The following classes are the core elements of this library. :code:`MaskedLM4Classification` works with masked
language models, while :code:`CausalLM4Classification` works with causal language models. The idea behind this concept
is described in :ref:`background`.

How these classes are applied are described in the tutorials :ref:`tutorial_causal_lms` and :ref:`tutorial_masked_lms`.
